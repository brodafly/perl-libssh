- working on authentification pubkey : http://api.libssh.org/master/libssh_tutor_authentication.html#authentication_details
- working on channels. function should use i think: 
  * ssh_channel_read_timeout 
  * ssh_channel_select
- I think i can create a function to get a channel "ID" with integers: local_channel . ':' . remote_channel
